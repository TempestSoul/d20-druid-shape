space/reach:
partly determined by size, but different attacks have different reach (dragons as prime example)
so...
* also, reach is itself affected by size, and there's a difference between ranged attacks
	and reach...
	reach w/ natural weapon = hits everything up to _ ft away (can be 2x normal or just better than normal)
	reach w/ manu. weapon = hits at 2x normal reach, but usually not normal reach
	ranged weapon = hit at any range, but take penalties over _ ft
	
also, there's the opposite -- some creatures have no reach,
because they have no attacks (shrieker fungus) or they're too small (rat, bat, etc)

So... Reach is Size (tall or long, which isn't defined!!), and attack/modifiers
argh... Either make Size have a subtype saying tall | long, and set it when parsing
space/reach (infer it), or just store both in some sort of structure unique to the creature.
(also, still have to add to attack.... well, technically attacks have a size. Actually, really
the attack consists of a weapon, combined with whether it's primary. The weapon
has size and reach built in, along with natural attack.)

So then,
Weapon (baseDamage, Size, damageTypes, isNatural, reach)
Attack (Weapon, isPrimary [, count])

so for Giant Squid:
	Size Huge (15 ft, [long])
	[Reach 15, tentacle reach 30]
	Attack (tentacle, true)
		Tentacle (1d6, Huge, true, 30)
	Attack (bite, false)
		Bite(2d8, Huge, BSP, true, 15)
Very Old Red Dragon:
	Size Gargantuan (20, [long])
	[Reach 15, bite 20]
	Attack (bite(4d6, G, bsp, true, 20), true)
	Attack (claw(2d8, G, bsp, true, 15), false, 2)
	Attack (wing(2d6,G, B, true, 15), false, 2)
	Attack (tail slap(2d8,G,B,true,15), false)

** should reorganize csv/parser so size & space/reach read around same time
